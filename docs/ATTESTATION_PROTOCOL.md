# EIP-712 Role Attestation Protocol

## Overview

This document specifies the GuildPass EIP-712 Role Attestation Protocol, which enables cryptographically verifiable proofs of role membership. An existing proof can be presented to third parties and verified without live backend availability while the required local data remains available.

## Device loss, reinstall, and recovery

Current attestations and their indexes are stored only on the device through
`migratingSecureStorage`, backed by Expo Secure Store. Secure Store data is
device-bound and is not transferred to a replacement device. Losing, wiping,
replacing the device, or reinstalling the app can permanently remove locally
cached attestations.

The current mobile app and GuildPass SDK do not expose a backend recovery or
attestation-listing endpoint. A connected wallet and recoverable membership do
not restore the previously issued attestation itself. When connectivity is
available, the user must request a newly issued attestation from the guild.

The app must not infer that a device is new merely because the attestation
collection is empty: an empty collection can also mean that the cache was
cleared, is unavailable, or is corrupted. The device-bound key must not be
exported, synchronized, weakened, or backed up.

## Motivation

Current role verification relies on backend API assertions:

- **Trust Model**: Trusting the backend's honesty at query time
- **Availability**: Requires live network connectivity to the GuildPass backend
- **Portability**: An existing cryptographic proof can be presented to third parties without backend intervention; the current implementation does not provide cross-device proof storage or recovery
- **Privacy**: Backend knows when and where roles are being verified

EIP-712 attestations address these limitations by:

- **Cryptographic Verification**: Mathematically proves a guild's issuer approved the role claim
- **Offline Verification**: Works entirely offline once cached (airplane mode compatible)
- **Cryptographic portability**: Can be presented to any verifier with the issuer public key
- **Privacy**: Verification requires no backend communication

### Data Flow

```
1. Request Attestation
   App → Backend (via SDK) → Get RoleAttestation signed by guild issuer

2. Verify & Cache
   App → Verify signature with cached issuer key
   App → Cache attestation for offline use

3. Offline Verification
   App → Can verify cached attestation + cached issuer key
   No network required
```

## Protocol Specification

### EIP-712 Domain

```javascript
{
  name: "GuildPass",
  version: "1.0",
  chainId: <blockchain-id>,
  verifyingContract: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```

The `verifyingContract` is a null address for now, as attestations are currently off-chain. This prevents accidental on-chain replay attacks.

### Message Type

```javascript
RoleAttestation: [
  { name: "guildId", type: "string" },
  { name: "roleId", type: "string" },
  { name: "wallet", type: "address" },
  { name: "issuedAt", type: "uint256" },
  { name: "expiresAt", type: "uint256" },
];
```

### Attestation Structure

```typescript
interface RoleAttestation {
  guildId: string; // Guild identifier
  roleId: string; // Role identifier
  wallet: "0x${string}"; // Holder's Ethereum address
  issuedAt: number; // Unix timestamp (seconds)
  expiresAt: number; // Unix timestamp (seconds)
  signature: "0x${string}"; // EIP-191 personal_sign or EIP-712 signature
}
```

### Issuer Key Registration

Guilds register their issuer key on-chain (implementation dependent on GuildPass protocol):

```typescript
interface GuildIssuerKey {
  guildId: string;
  issuerAddress: "0x${string}";
  registeredAt: number; // When registered on-chain
  cachedAt: number; // When cached locally (ms)
}
```

**Key Rotation**: When a guild rotates its issuer key:

1. New key is registered on-chain
2. Mobile app cache is automatically invalidated (7 day TTL by default)
3. App fetches new key from backend on next verification
4. Old attestations signed by previous key remain valid until expiration (signature verification works for any registered key)

## Verification Process

### Validation Ordering

`validateAttestation()` runs checks in the following order, deliberately chosen
to minimise work before rejecting an invalid attestation:

1. **Expiry check** (O(1), no I/O) — cheapest check first.
2. **Revocation check** (in-memory Map lookup) — faster than crypto.
3. **Cryptographic signature verification** (asymmetric crypto) — most expensive, performed last.

### Revocation-Aware Online Verification (with backend)

```
1. Fetch attestation from backend
   - walletAddress, guildId, roleId → RoleAttestation (with optional kid)

2. Fetch issuer key (cached or fresh)
   - If cache miss: fetch from backend
   - Cache locally for 7 days

3. Check expiration
   - Current time < attestation.expiresAt

4. Check issuer key revocation
   - Look up issuer address in the cached revocation registry
   - If data unavailable (offline, no cached registry): FAIL CLOSED — reject
   - If key is revoked: reject with ATTESTATION_REVOCATION_REASONS.KEY_REVOKED

5. Verify signature
   - Use viem's verifyTypedData
   - Recover signer from signature
   - Compare to issuer address

6. Cache result
  - Store attestation in local `migratingSecureStorage` (Expo Secure Store)
  - Store validation result
```

### Revocation-Aware Offline Verification (cached)

```
1. Load attestation from local cache
   - If not found: fail (requires online fetch first)

2. Load issuer key from cache
   - If not found: fail (requires online fetch first)

3. Check expiration
   - Current time < attestation.expiresAt

4. Check issuer key revocation from cached registry
   - If cached revocation data available (within offline trust window): check it
   - If NOT available (cache expired or never fetched): FAIL CLOSED — reject

5. Verify signature locally
   - Use cached issuer key
   - No network required

6. Return result
```

### Error Cases

| Scenario                              | Behavior                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Invalid signature                     | Rejected, not cached                                       |
| Expired attestation                   | Rejected, removed from cache if cached                     |
| Revoked issuer key                    | Rejected with `issuerKeyRevoked: true`                     |
| Revocation data unavailable (offline) | Rejected with `revocationCheckSkipped: true` (fail closed) |
| Missing issuer key (offline)          | Fails with "Issuer key not cached - requires online fetch" |
| Network error fetching attestation    | Returns cached version if available                        |
| Network error fetching issuer key     | Uses cached key if available, otherwise fails              |
| Tampered attestation                  | Rejected during signature verification                     |

## Security Considerations

### Signature Verification

- Uses EIP-712 typed data to prevent phishing attacks
- Domain separation prevents cross-app/cross-chain replay
- All message fields are included in the signature hash

### Expiration Handling

- Attestations must be checked against current time
- Clock skew handling: consider removing attestations that are >1 hour past expiration
- Front-end should refresh attestations approaching expiration

### Issuer Key Revocation Model

GuildPass attestations adopt the same issuer key revocation model as the QR
access path (see `docs/qr-key-rotation-protocol.md`). Each guild publishes
its key registry (active keys + revoked key set) via the SDK, and the client
caches it locally with a bounded TTL.

**Key identifier (`kid`)**

An optional `kid` field in `RoleAttestation` identifies which specific issuer
key signed the proof. When a guild has multiple rotating keys, including
`kid` enables the verifier to check whether that particular key has been
revoked.

**Revocation check flow**

```
validateAttestation()
  ├── 1. Check expiry
  ├── 2. Check revocation  ← NEW
  │       └── checkIssuerKeyRevoked(guildId, issuerAddress)
  │             ├── Cache fresh (< 15 min TTL) → use cached data
  │             ├── Cache expired but within trust window (24 h)
  │             │     → attempt refresh; fall back to cached on failure
  │             └── No cache / past trust window → return null (fail closed)
  └── 3. Verify signature
```

**Offline policy: FAIL CLOSED**

When the revocation registry data is unavailable (no cached copy and the
device is offline), `validateAttestation()` **rejects** the attestation with
`revocationCheckSkipped: true`. This is the deliberate conservative policy:

- Attestations are designed as **cryptographically portable, long-lived
  proofs** — they may be verified months after issuance by a third-party
  verifier with no connection to the GuildPass backend when the proof and
  required verification data are available.
- Accepting a proof whose issuer key status cannot be confirmed would
  allow a compromised key's attestations to be accepted indefinitely.
- An online verifier can always fetch fresh revocation data; the fail-closed
  policy only affects offline scenarios where the cached registry has
  expired (24-hour trust window).

**Revocation data caching parameters**

| Parameter            | Value             |
| -------------------- | ----------------- |
| In-memory cache TTL  | 15 minutes        |
| Offline trust window | 24 hours          |
| Persisted storage    | Expo Secure Store |

These mirror the QR path's parameters exactly, ensuring consistent
behaviour across both verification paths.

### Issuer Key Management

- Issuer keys are public data (address only)
- Keys are cached locally for 7 days max
- Manual refresh available after guild admin key rotation
- Expired cache invalidates automatically

### Cache Security

- Attestations and their indexes are stored through `migratingSecureStorage`,
  backed by device-bound Expo Secure Store. Older sensitive values may be
  migrated one way from AsyncStorage on the same device; this does not make
  Secure Store data recoverable on another device.
- Cache is per-wallet-address (no cross-wallet data leakage)
- No private keys stored
- User can clear cache anytime

### Portability and storage recovery

Cryptographic portability means that an existing attestation can be
independently presented and verified offline. Storage portability and recovery
mean synchronizing, backing up, or restoring proofs across devices; the
current implementation does none of these.

**Portability of the proof format does not imply backup, durability, or
cross-device recovery.**

### Offline Limitations

- Offline verification only works with cached data
- Cannot verify new attestations without network
- Cannot fetch new issuer keys offline
- Cannot update expiration checks without current time
- **Offline revocation checks require cached revocation data within the 24-hour trust window** — after 24 hours without connectivity, attestations are rejected (fail closed)

## Integration Guide

### 1. Initialize Attestation Service

```typescript
import { AttestationService } from "@/features/attestation/attestationService";
import { guildPassClient } from "@/lib/guildpassClient";

const attestationService = new AttestationService({
  chainId: 1, // Ethereum mainnet
  fetchIssuerKey: (guildId) => guildPassClient.attestation.getIssuerKey(guildId),
  fetchAttestation: (params) => guildPassClient.attestation.getAttestation(params),
});
```

The current GuildPass SDK exposes guilds, roles, membership, access, and
contracts services, but no attestation retrieval APIs. Implementing recovery
would require a backend API that retains and lists previously issued
attestations; no such recovery integration is currently available.

### 2. Use in Components

```typescript
import { useAttestationVerification } from '@/features/attestation/useAttestations';

function RoleDisplay({ walletAddress, guildId, roleId }) {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useAttestationVerification(
    attestationService,
    walletAddress,
    guildId,
    roleId
  );

  if (error) return <div>Failed: {error}</div>;
  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading attestation...</div>;

  if (data?.valid) {
    return <div>
      ✓ Role verified {data.validityStatus}
    </div>;
  }

  return <div>Role not verified: {data?.error}</div>;
}
```

### 3. Offline Verification

```typescript
// Check if can verify offline (both attestation and issuer key cached)
const { data: canVerifyOffline } = useCachedAttestationExists(
  attestationService,
  walletAddress,
  guildId,
  roleId,
);

// Verify offline (no network required)
const { data: result } = useLocalAttestationVerification(
  attestationService,
  walletAddress,
  guildId,
  roleId,
);
```

### 4. Handling Key Rotation

```typescript
const refreshKeyMutation = useRefreshIssuerKey(attestationService);

const onGuildKeyRotation = async (guildId: string) => {
  await refreshKeyMutation.mutateAsync(guildId);
  // Re-verify all attestations for this guild
};
```

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs

- Replace signatures with ZK proofs for privacy
- Hide guild membership while proving eligibility

### Device Co-Signing (Exploratory)

**Status**: Feasibility investigation complete, prototype available. See `docs/device-signing-feasibility.md` for full analysis.

**Concept**: Enable device-bound cryptographic proofs that strengthen presentation-time trust by having the user's device co-sign attestations with a hardware-backed key.

**Motivation**:
- Current attestations prove "the issuer said this wallet has this role"
- Device co-signing would prove "the person physically presenting this device attests to it right now"
- Strengthens offline/portable verification with device possession proof
- Hardware-backed keys (iOS Secure Enclave, Android StrongBox) provide non-extractable private keys

**Feasibility Findings**:
- ✅ Hardware-backed asymmetric key generation is possible via `expo-hardware-key` or `expo-device-crypto`
- ✅ iOS Secure Enclave and Android StrongBox/TEE integration is feasible
- ✅ Biometric authentication can be required for signing operations
- ❌ Direct EIP-712 signing not possible due to curve incompatibility (P-256 vs secp256k1)
- ❌ `expo-secure-store` does not support asymmetric key operations

**Proposed Approaches**:

1. **Hybrid Device Attestation** (Recommended)
   - Device signs attestation hash with P-256 hardware key
   - Combined proof: { issuerSignature (secp256k1), deviceSignature (P-256), devicePublicKey }
   - Verifier validates both signatures independently
   - Requires protocol extension but doesn't break existing attestations

2. **Hardware-Protected secp256k1 Key**
   - Use hardware key to encrypt/protect a software-based secp256k1 key
   - Enables EIP-712 signing with hardware protection
   - Private key exists in memory during signing (vulnerability window)

3. **Alternative Attestation Format**
   - Separate EIP-712-like format for device attestations using P-256
   - Clean separation but requires new protocol specification

**Prototype Status**:
- Isolated prototype module: `src/features/attestation/experimental/deviceSigning.ts`
- Co-signing flow prototype: `src/features/attestation/experimental/deviceCoSigning.ts`
- NOT integrated with production attestation flow
- Requires physical device testing (iOS 15.1+, Android API 23+)

**Next Steps** (If approved):
1. Install `expo-hardware-key` dependency
2. Test prototype on physical devices
3. Choose integration approach (Hybrid recommended)
4. Design protocol extension for co-signed attestations
5. Update verification pipeline to handle device signatures
6. Add UI for device key management

**Blockers**:
- Curve incompatibility requires protocol-level workaround
- External library dependency adds maintenance burden
- Platform differences require careful testing
